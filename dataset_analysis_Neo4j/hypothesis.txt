This is a short analysis of a group of potentially genetically connected
diseases based on linked communities found using tools available in Neo4j.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I chose community "c10" from my groupings. Using the the cypher query

    match(n:c10) return(n.name)

yields a list of the disease names as follows (I added numbers for reference):

    1.  "aortic aneurysm, familial thoracic 3"
    2.  "dyspnea, paroxysmal"
    3.  "cystic medial necrosis of aorta"
    4.  "aortic valve insufficiency"
    5.  "coronary artery disease"
    6.  "hyperlipoproteinemia type iia"
    7.  "cutis marmorata"
    8.  "atherosclerosis"
    9.  "loeys-dietz aortic aneurysm syndrome"
    10. "hyperlipidemia"
    11. "hypercholesterolemia"
    12. "left-sided heart failure"
    13. "hypercholesterolemia, familial"
    14. "coronary heart disease"

I believe that the gene that associates the diseases in this community is at
least partially responsible for the strength of the tissue of the aorta (the 
main artery that carries blood away from the heart).
We can connect several diseases on the list to weak tissue in the aorta.
Disease (1) from the list is caused by a *"weakened and stretched" aorta.
This connects to disease (2) in an unexpected way. Disease (2) is characterized
by **"severe shortness of breath". The shortness of breath is not due to a lung
issue, but actually with the amount of oxygen that being delivered by blood.
The widened aorta means that blood cannot be pumped efficiently, which causes
a lack of oxygenated blood throughout the body. Moving on to disease (4) we
find the primary cause to be ***"aortic root dilation", which is tied to the
aortic tissue being stretched, which is similar to both diseases we've looked
at thus far. Another good example comes from disease (12), which is
***"characterized by the heart's inability to pump an adequate supply of blood
to the body". Once again, weak aortic tissue seems to be the root cause here,
because a dilated aorta would cause the heart to have to work too hard to pump
blood to the body, which would result in failure.
Our research has shown that many of these diseases are strongly tied to a
dilated aorta, which can result from weak aortic tissue. For this reason, I
hyphothesize that the gene connecting my chosen community is likely related to
weak aortic tissue.
