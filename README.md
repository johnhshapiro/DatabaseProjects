# Database-Projects
Various database projects I completed while taking the course Principles of Database Systems during the Fall 2019 Semester at Metropolitan State University of Denver

## Dataset Parsing: SQL
This project builds a relational database in SQL from [this dataset](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/mjeb-it4m).
A python script is used to parse the data from its original format and to enter the data into an SQL database.

## Database Queries: SQL
This project loads a provided database into SQL from a file. The dataset and overall database structure is similar to that of the **Dataset Parsing: SQL** project outlined above this one.
This project demonstrates the use of various types of SQL queries to find specified subsets of data.

## Database Queries: MongoDB
This homework includes examples of MongoDB queries that would be used with the included data set (companies.json)

## Dataset Analysis: Neo4j
This project loads a dataset of genetically connected diseases into Neo4j and demonstrates how data can be exported, parsed, grouped, and labelled in order to visualize data and create hypotheses.
A Python script is used to create a parse, group, and label data and output a cypher that can be used to enter the grouped communities into Neo4j.
For this project, a text file with a hypothesis about one of the communities (selected by the student) was required as a deliverable. I have included my hypothesis to show how Neo4j community data can be applied.
