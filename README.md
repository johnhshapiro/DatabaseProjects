# Database-Projects
Various database projects I completed while taking the course Principles of Database Systems during the Fall 2019 Semester at Metropolitan State University of Denver

## Dataset Parsing
This project builds a relational database in SQL from [this dataset](https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/mjeb-it4m).
A python script is used to parse the data from its original format and to enter the data into an SQL database.

## Database Queries
This project loads a provided database into SQL from a file. The dataset and overall database structure is similar to that of the **Dataset Parsing** project outlined above this one.
This project demonstrates the use of various types of SQL queries to find specified subsets of data.
